# Color<br>
This is just a basic header file that adds a COLORREF for every type of color that I can find. Keeps things more uniform in a program and less risk of typos cause errors.<BR><br>
Using it is simple, just include the file into your C++ program and then use the namespace COLOR to access the color you want.<br><br>
>COLOR::BLUE

<br>
Anyone who has more colors, please send them to me to share and update this. I reference all locations where I get the colors at the end of the file so others can see where I got it and also verify there are no typing errors.<br><br>
No license for this, free to use as you please. Just give me credit for putting it together for you.
